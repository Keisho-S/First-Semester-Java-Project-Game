# First-Semester-Java-Project-Game
Be sure you open the right order of the folder as I showed in file"how to play", if open wrong folder, object picture link maybe break.
This is my first semester java project game. 
VS Code terminal game. 
Walk on chessboard, find treasure and beat boss. 
Very simple,
you can find how to play in the folder.
